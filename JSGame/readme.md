## End of JavaScript Unit

This simple game tests how quickly you can click on a shape that appears on the screen. To start the game, simply click the "Start" button". Shapes will stop appearing once you hit "Stop." 

During the game, either a circle or a square will appear anywhere under the buttons. It will be a random color and size. Once you click on the shape, there will be a slight delay before the next shape appears, giving you time to look at your result. 

Happy clicking!
